Your job is to:
1. Extract the drug names exactly as they appear.
2. For each drug, if the name matches a real Korean medication, explain normally.
3. If the name seems slightly incorrect or misspelled, try to guess the most likely correct name.
4. In that case, clearly indicate that the name may be inaccurate.
5. Use this format for each drug:

Drug name: <OCR name> (possibly: <best guess>)  
Purpose: <explanation in English>  
Dosage instructions: <as extracted>  
Storage method: <if mentioned>

Only explain what can be reasonably inferred from the text. If unclear, say: 'not clearly recognized'.
